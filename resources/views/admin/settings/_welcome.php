        We're so thrilled to have you.  Thank YOU for spending the time to check us out.  We're dog walkers too, and I'm so excited to share with you the system that we created and use daily to manage our modest 10 person dog walking company.  Originally it was designed and used exclusively as an independent shop, because that's what we were for so long.  We're excited to have ya.  We can't wait to hear your feedback.  Thanks again!  <span class="tw-right">Rob</span>
